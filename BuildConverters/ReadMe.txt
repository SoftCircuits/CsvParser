This project is a console application that builds all the data converter
code, and also creates test data for the unit tests project. You will
need to run this program to generate the target files.

The program reads the templates in the Templates folder and uses them to
generate the code and data.

- Converter.template: Contains the templates for all the data converters
in the Converters folder of the main project.

- DataConverters.template: Contains the templates for the DataConverter
class (also in the Converters folder of the main project).

- DataConvertersTestClass.template: Creates test class and data for the
unit tests project.
